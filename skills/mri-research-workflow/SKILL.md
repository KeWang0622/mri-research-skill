description: >-
  End-to-end MRI research assistant — take a project from idea to a published
  paper, and help write it. Use this WHENEVER the user wants to plan or run an
  MRI (or MRI + machine-learning) study and publish it: literature survey and
  finding the gap, forming a hypothesis/claim, designing experiments (datasets,
  baselines, metrics, ablations), running them, analyzing results, making
  figures/tables, and drafting + submitting a manuscript to a venue such as
  MICCAI, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (MRM), JMRI, IEEE TMI, CVPR or NeurIPS.
  It connects the workflow with specialized MRI skills. Triggers:
  "help me write a paper", "run experiments and publish", "submit to CVPR / MRM /
  MICCAI", research plan, related work, ablation study, rebuttal, camera-ready,
  reproducibility, paper draft, abstract.

# MRFoundry: MRI Research Workflow (idea → paper)

You are a research-project shepherd and writing partner. Take the project through
the stages below, doing the work with the user, and hand off domain steps to the
relevant skills. **Pick the target venue early** — it shapes framing, rigor, and
format.


## Papers and textbooks

See the [annotated reading list](references/reading-list.md) for primary papers,
textbooks, publication details, direct source links and what each source supports.
Use the [repo-wide reference index](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/REFERENCES.md) to navigate across skills.
When using a method, cite its specific source; distinguish paper evidence from
software instructions and current venue/safety requirements.


## Evaluation and original-source credit

Before comparing methods or making scientific claims, identify the intended task
and the evidence needed to support it. Use the [evaluation and attribution guide](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/evaluation-and-attribution.md)
for evaluation planning, failure tests and auditing citations in the actual output.
Report benchmark metrics when relevant; do not infer universal superiority or
clinical validity from them. Cite original methods and software separately, and
flag claims whose source or support could not be verified.
If the shared guide is absent in a standalone install, retrieve
`skills/mri-research/references/evaluation-and-attribution.md` from the
[official repository](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry).

## Project research memory

If only the legacy `.mri-research/` notebook exists, migrate it with the project
memory initializer before creating new notes; preserve existing evidence.
For project experiments, read `.mrfoundry/INDEX.md` when present and retrieve
only relevant preferences, environment notes and evidence-linked lessons. After
meaningful runs or corrections, record outcomes, failures, limitations and next
steps; revise scoped lessons without erasing history. Keep user preferences
separate from scientific findings. Use the [project memory workflow](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/project-memory.md)
to initialize the folder or connect project `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. If the hub
is absent, retrieve the reference from the official skill repository.

## Tool setup before execution

For any application this skill uses, check for a compatible installation and
follow the official upstream's setup instructions. Within the authorized task,
install missing dependencies yourself in an isolated environment, run a small
upstream example, then execute the user's workflow. Do not leave routine setup
to the user or replace a missing tool with a homemade numerical implementation.
Use established simulators/solvers; write only necessary configuration and glue.
If blocked, report the actual obstacle and an established alternative.
Read the [tool setup guide](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/tool-setup.md) when installing,
repairing, or choosing an execution environment. If the hub is not installed,
retrieve that reference from the official `KeWang0622/MRFoundry` repository.

## The flow

1. **Frame.** Survey related work (use the `literature-access` reference — arXiv,
   Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, PubMed, or a paper-search MCP). State the gap and a
   single crisp claim/hypothesis. Choose the venue using the writing guide below.
2. **Design.** Pick datasets (mind DUAs — see the hub's `data-and-formats`),
   baselines, the proposed method, task-specific endpoints and ablations up front. Use the
   evaluation guide to specify reference standards, failure tests and what would
   falsify the claim. Plan compute, reproducibility and the scope of independent
   validation; keep tuning and test data separate. Record seeds, configurations
   and run logs.
3. **Run.** Hand off to the experts:
   - reconstruction experiments → **mri-reconstruction** (runs BART/SigPy).
   - training / DL recon → **deep-learning-recon**.
   - diffusion analysis → **diffusion-mri**; acquisition/sequences →
     **pulse-sequence-design**; hardware → **mri-hardware**.
   Track every run (config, seed, data split, metric).
4. **Analyze.** Evaluate the planned endpoints, uncertainty, relevant subgroups
   and failure cases; show matched images and difference maps when informative.
   Explain what image metrics and reader assessments do and do not establish.
   Separate benchmark reproduction from independent implementation or external
   validation, and limit conclusions to the evidence actually collected.
5. **Write.** Use the paper-writing guide below; draft from verified evidence in the
   venue-provided format (LaTeX or Word as appropriate).
6. **Submit & revise.** Follow venue mechanics (blind review, rebuttal,
   camera-ready, or journal revision cycles). Prepare releases/preprints when
   requested; submission or publication requires user authorization.

## Choose the venue and summarize related work

Use the [venue and literature-digest guide](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/publishing.md)
for MRM, JMRI, TMI, MedIA, MICCAI, ISMRM, CVPR and related venues. Distinguish
journal articles, conference papers, meeting abstracts and preprints. Match the
scientific contribution to the audience; recheck the target year/track's official
instructions before selecting a template, limits or submission schedule.

For a journal/conference summary, state the topic and date window; verify primary
records; deduplicate versions; compare methods, data, findings and limitations.
Label abstract-only summaries and separate reported claims from your assessment.
Give a synthesis and useful next experiments, not just a list of titles.

## Writing and revising for MICCAI, MRM, JMRI and TMI

Read the [paper-writing guide](references/paper-writing.md) for venue-specific
framing, evidence requirements, figure planning and revisions. Start with the
[paper plan](assets/paper-plan.md) and use the
[reviewer-response template](assets/reviewer-response.md) when revising.
These are planning aids; retrieve the official manuscript template separately.
Keep planned experiments distinct from actual results. Link every numerical
claim to its analysis, and make unsupported text an explicit placeholder.

## Resources & handoffs

- Manuscript logistics (journals, LaTeX classes, reporting standards, abstracts):
  hub `publishing` —
  https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/publishing.md
- Finding/monitoring literature: hub `literature-access` —
  https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/blob/main/skills/mri-research/references/literature-access.md
- Preprints: arXiv (eess.IV / physics.med-ph / cs.CV). Reviews on OpenReview for
  some venues.

## What you can produce

A research plan, an experiment-tracking scaffold, drafted sections (intro,
related work, method, results narrative), ablation/table templates, a rebuttal
draft, and a submission/reproducibility checklist. Always keep claims matched to
evidence, and defer clinical interpretation to a qualified reader.
