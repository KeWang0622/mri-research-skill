Coding agents can write MRI code, but choosing the right signal model, data convention, tool and validation takes domain knowledge. **MRFoundry** gives your agent curated guidance and primary references across MRI physics, acquisition, reconstruction, analysis and publishing.

**Seven installable skills · Established scientific tools · Project-local research memory**

## Quick start

Install with the open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), then select the skills and supported coding agents you want to use:

```bash
npx skills add KeWang0622/MRFoundry -g
```

Start with a request in your agent:

> Design a golden-angle radial gradient-echo in PyPulseq and simulate it first. Then reconstruct the simulated data and check whether the image meets the research goal.

The skills guide tool selection, setup, execution and checks. Scientific applications such as PyPulseq, KomaMRI and BART are installed separately as needed; the agent is instructed to handle routine setup in an isolated environment and test an upstream example before use.

**[Explore the interactive tutorial →](https://kewang0622.github.io/slides/mrfoundry/)** — agents, skills, MRI examples and the self-improvement workflow. [Presentation information](presentations/README.md).

<details>
<summary>Install one skill, choose an agent, or update</summary>

```bash
# Install only for the current project
npx skills add KeWang0622/MRFoundry

# Choose one skill
npx skills add KeWang0622/MRFoundry --skill mri-reconstruction

# Target a supported agent
npx skills add KeWang0622/MRFoundry -a claude-code

# Browse without installing
npx skills add KeWang0622/MRFoundry --list

# Update installed global skills
npx skills update -g
```

Choose one, several or all seven skills. Browse the [skills directory](https://github.com/KeWang0622/MRFoundry/tree/main/skills). These are Markdown instructions and supporting helpers; installing them does not install every scientific application or grant access to restricted datasets.

</details>

## How it works

**You set the research goal. The agent uses skills as guidance and tools to take action.** A task may need several skills; the seven skills are not seven separate models.

```mermaid

  U["Your request<br/>Question, data, constraints"] --> A["Agent<br/>Plan and select knowledge"]
  S["MRI skills<br/>Methods, sources, caveats"] --> A
  A --> T["Scientific tools<br/>Install, test, execute"]

  E --> R["Researcher review<br/>Does it meet the goal?"]
  R -->|Revise| A
  R --> M["Project memory<br/>Lessons and preferences"]
  M -.->|Retrieve and recheck| A
```

Tools include **PyPulseq** for sequence definitions, **KomaMRI** for simulation, **BART / SigPy** for reconstruction, and **MRtrix3 / DIPY** for diffusion analysis. Data resources and papers supply inputs and evidence; skills help the agent choose and use them.

### Research phases

| Phase | What the agent helps with | What to inspect |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Frame the question** | Read primary literature, identify the gap, combine relevant skills. | A specific question, assumptions and success criteria. |
| **2 · Design the study** | Choose data, acquisition or simulation, baselines and metrics. | A feasible plan with controls and comparison conditions. |
| **3 · Run the work** | Set up established tools; simulate, reconstruct or analyze. | Commands, versions, outputs and failed attempts. |
| **4 · Evaluate the evidence** | Inspect images and results; test assumptions, accuracy and robustness. | Whether the result supports the claim—not just whether code ran. |
| **5 · Write and improve** | Draft figures and methods; record scoped lessons for the next task. | Traceable claims, limitations and reusable project knowledge. |

These phases are iterative. New evidence or user feedback can send the work back to an earlier decision. The [research-workflow skill](skills/mri-research-workflow/SKILL.md) connects the phases; specialist skills supply the domain guidance.

## Choose your skills

Start with **mri-research** for orientation, **mri-research-workflow** for a study, or a specialist for a focused task.

| Skill | Use it for | Typical tools or resources |
|---|---|---|
| [MRI research](skills/mri-research/SKILL.md) | Physics, references, cross-domain questions and image-level analysis | Courses, papers, BIDS, FSL, FreeSurfer |
| [Research workflow](skills/mri-research-workflow/SKILL.md) | Question → study design → experiments → manuscript | Literature, baselines, metrics, venue guidance |
| [Reconstruction](skills/mri-reconstruction/SKILL.md) | Raw k-space, coil maps, parallel imaging, compressed sensing, non-Cartesian recon | BART, SigPy, ISMRMRD |
| [Sequence design](skills/pulse-sequence-design/SKILL.md) | GRE, SE/FSE, EPI, diffusion preparation, DENSE and simulation | Pulseq/PyPulseq, KomaMRI, vendor references |
| [Deep-learning reconstruction](skills/deep-learning-recon/SKILL.md) | Trained, unrolled, self-supervised and diffusion-based recon | DIRECT, ATOMMIC, fastMRI |
| [Diffusion MRI](skills/diffusion-mri/SKILL.md) | DWI/DTI, ADC/FA/MD, preprocessing, fiber orientations and tractography | MRtrix3, DIPY, FSL, QSIPrep |
| [Hardware](skills/mri-hardware/SKILL.md) | Coils, gradients, low-field systems, shimming and safety orientation | MaRCoS, OCRA, EM and shim tools |

### Explore the expanded guides

- **[DWI and DTI](skills/diffusion-mri/references/dwi-dti.md):** from diffusion-weighted volumes and gradient tables to tensor maps, quality checks and interpretation.
- **[Sequence families, EPI and DENSE](skills/mri-research/references/sequences-and-trajectories.md#sequence-families-contrast-encoding-and-readout):** what each measures, what to validate, and which established examples/tools to use.
- **[Journals, conferences and paper summaries](skills/mri-research/references/publishing.md):** MRM, MICCAI, ISMRM, CVPR and related venues; contribution fit and a reproducible literature-digest workflow.

## Research memory

Each project can keep a private **`.mrfoundry/`** notebook. The improvement loop is **retrieve → execute → evaluate → update → reuse and verify**.

```text
.mrfoundry/
├── INDEX.md          # Relevant work and next steps
├── preferences.md    # Your explicit research habits
├── environment.md    # Working tools, versions and setup checks
├── runs/             # Experiments, outcomes and failures
└── lessons.md        # Reusable findings with evidence and limits
```

A lesson should change a concrete decision in the next task, then be checked again. Keep user preferences separate from scientific conclusions, and retain failed or superseded findings. Project `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` can point agents to the notebook; this is instruction-based memory, not model retraining or guaranteed automatic learning.

Existing `.mri-research/` notebooks migrate to `.mrfoundry/` with the same initializer; existing notes are preserved. If both folders exist, reconcile them before migrating.

## Write an MRI paper

The [paper-writing guide](skills/mri-research-workflow/references/paper-writing.md)
connects **claims → experiment evidence → figures → manuscript → reviewer responses**,
with distinct guidance for **MICCAI, MRM, JMRI and IEEE TMI** and links to official
instructions. Start with an editable [paper plan](skills/mri-research-workflow/assets/paper-plan.md).

> “Use my experiment records to plan an MRM paper. Map each claim to evidence,
> propose the figures, and flag missing analyses before drafting the abstract.”

The included diffusion study is an illustrative planning example, not reported
experimental results. The agent should never fill missing evidence with plausible numbers.

## Try a research question

| Your request | Knowledge the agent needs to combine |
|---|---|
| “Why do my eight receive channels look different, and how can reconstruction use that?” | Coil sensitivity and hardware + reconstruction's encoding model |
| “Design a golden-angle GRE, simulate it, then reconstruct its data.” | Sequence timing + hardware constraints + Bloch simulation + non-Cartesian reconstruction |
| “Plan a reproducible MRI reconstruction study for MRM.” | Literature + data conventions + baselines + evaluation + scientific writing |
| “Could free water explain this change in diffusion metrics?” | Diffusion models + confounds + controlled experiment design |

These are example requests, not prerecorded successful runs. Results depend on the agent, tool access, data and validation.

## Reference library

**[Papers and textbooks by skill →](REFERENCES.md)** — all seven skills have an
annotated reading list with full citations, direct source links and the topic
each reference supports.

The hub links to primary papers, courses, datasets and software across MRI. It summarizes when a resource is useful rather than redistributing it.

## Reliability and scope

- **Established implementations.** Use the scientific tool's official setup and examples; do not replace missing dependencies with an improvised simulator or solver.
- **Evidence before claims.** Execution, data consistency, image quality and scientific validity need different checks. Researcher judgment remains essential.
- **Evaluation and attribution.** [Practical guidance](skills/mri-research/references/evaluation-and-attribution.md) connects claims to task-specific evidence, distinguishes reproduction from independent validation, and checks original-source credit in outputs. These are agent instructions, not guarantees of compliance.
- **Checked references.** CI checks structure, version consistency, links and upstream availability; scheduled checks flag archival and drift. Passing CI does not validate scientific conclusions, and some hosts block automated link checks.
- **Appropriate use.** Image-reading material is research orientation, not clinical diagnosis. Scanner operation needs local validation. External software and datasets retain their own licenses and access requirements.

## Contributing

Bring a correction, a useful primary reference or a workflow you have tested. A strong contribution includes **the problem, supporting evidence and the proposed change**. Share reviewed, generalizable lessons; keep personal research notebooks private unless intentionally shared.
